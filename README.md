GhToGhx is a CommandLine tool which scans folder structures on disk for Grasshopper definition files (extension .gh), starting from a folder given as a CommandLine option (a filename or a folder) and optionally a command as well (as illustrated below). 

It has commands for listing gh and ghx files and or converting gh to ghx and temp folders for storing converted ghx being autogenerated by this tool. 
THere's also a command for deleting the .ghx copies.

Any .ghx copies converted with this tool is placed in a subfolder below location of the original gh-file, and thus the tools can also delete the subfolders if the .ghx copy no longer is needed.

_Fig 1. Here an example of Convert ("C") gh files into .ghx versions placed into subfolders named **...\ghx_tmp**_

The tool grabs all gh files in the specified folder (first argument) which doesn't have any ghx equivalent file in the same folder, and makes a .ghx-copy in a sub-folder named ...\_ghx_tmp\. _(Notice that the first version doesn't handle individual files, it only iterates over all files in the specified filepath, disregarding any specified filename)_.

_Fig 2. Pressing the commandline option D (stands for "Dir") to list any temp folders for ghx files created with the Convert command. 5 temp folders was been created, containing .ghx versions of the gh files:_

_Fig 3. ... then press "X" for a list of gh**x** files, of which some already existed before the conversion (and therefore these files were not copied or converted), only a few gh-files (seven) were converted and placed in their respective ```\_ghx_tmp``` subfolders (this is so they can easily be deleted later):_

_Fig 4.Pressing "G" lists all gh files under the current path, in this case the seven gh-files which were converted above:_

_Fig 5. And finally, pressing R for remove, removes the temp folders and files altogether (Ops, I just now noticed that the reporting of the number of deleted files is missing.):_

**Grasshopper made searcheable**
So all in all, these few commands conveniently makes Grasshopper binary files searcheable in a few seconds (Hint: tools like [PowerGrep](https://www.powergrep.com/), [RegexBuddy](https://www.regexbuddy.com/) and [EditpadPro](https://www.editpadpro.com/) are very useful for regex searching and text manipulation).

**HOW TO USE**
Compile the project with a reference to the GH_IO.dll, (__your own_ copy_ which is located under the Rhino program install folder) and also place a copy in the same folder as the compiled exe-file (wherever you put it) and it should just work.

* To run the  program, Win10 typically want you to type a period and a slash before the app name, like so:

  **.\ghtoghx.exe [...your filepath...]** :

* It is adviced to terminate any folder path with a backslash as to prevent the path from being truncated one step.
* If you add a second option after the filepath, like G, X, D, C or R (R = Remove), then the app will execute the command and terminate directly after.

Enjoy!
